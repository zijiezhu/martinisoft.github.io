The Epilogue of Burnout

About two years ago I candidly wrote about [my story of burnout][1] and wanted to update everyone on my progress. My hope is that those in a similar situation can gain some insights and this exercise can be a little therapeutic for me. This post was prompted by a recent team meetup where I ended up being a lot more honest than I think I've ever been in my career.

It started with an exercise given to me by my boss where we each answered the question "How does the company serve you?". This question was meant to reveal what motivates us to be with the company and what our personal goals might be. Is the company helping with a passion of yours? Is the freedom letting you spend more time with family? My answer was "At my previous job I wanted to learn about performance and joined this job for a similar reason, but I feel I've not gotten any of that and I'm thinking of leaving". That statement instantly silenced the room while looks of concern washed over everyones face. I'm not sure what brought on that honesty, but it was a sign something was wrong.

Immediately after that discussion was a conversation with my boss about what prompted that response. Looking back over the two years of work I'm pretty proud of what I have accomplished. Lots of major changes, public contributions, and speaking engagements. It's a lot of work overall, but it wasn't entirely fulfilling work for me. Years ago in that previous job where I had burnout my personal goal was to learn about the deepest parts of the stack and gain knowledge about performance. How to tune the operating system, tweak memory, take measurements, etc. This time around, the story was much the same, but the circumstances were different.

The story of burnout is a common one I hear from others in the technology field. There is that thing you join for, but what you get is different. That thing you join for can be for better benefits, an interesting problem you want to tackle, or maybe the opportunity to work with a specific person. It's focused by an overall company goal driven by stake holders, or an immediate goal like an emergency. In my experience and learning from others in the industry is that reason eventually vanishes before you realize it. Your company is acquired, a co worker leaves, your stake holder re-focuses tasks away from that interesting problem. Those events are a warning signal for me now. A wake up call to examine my career in the context of the company I work for and if it is worth my time.

Not being able to tackle that interesting problem was my reason for bringing up that statement to my co workers and a lot of the reason for leaving my previous job. I was willing to sacrifice my well being and marriage to get at the problem of performance. It was the carrot on the stick that I would dance in front of myself day in and day out during each late night. Does this phrase sound familiar? "If I just get these things done, I can finally get to this". Though sadly, that thing I wanted to look at was never really there. Always seemingly within reach, but out of reach at the same time.

For me, that chase was the valley of burnout. Yes, I was learning a lot, but it felt that very few of the things I was doing helped me learn about performance. There was always a fire to put out, a new server to provision, something else to document. I never felt empowered to put those things aside to work on the thing I wanted to learn. While the other tasks were worthy endeavors, it was not what I signed up to learn 2 years ago.

If my story is sounding familiar to you, ask your manager to get the team to answer one simple question as honestly as possible. How can the _company_ serve _you_? You might be surprised what you mearn about yourself and your career path. We all have motivators that drive us to make different descisions in our life and career and I think it's time we start being a bit more honest about those motivations even if we perceieve those motivations as vain or selfish. I'm not entirely sure what will happen these next few months, but I feel energized again and excited to see where everything goes now.
