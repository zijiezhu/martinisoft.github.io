title: Evolution of a Presentation (Part 1)
---

I'm often asked to explain my process behind creating and delivering a presentation. This post will be one of four parts in a series I am calling "Evolution of a Presentation" because it will go behind the scenes of my talk on copyright called "Hey, kid! Don't copy that floppy!" You'll see my thought process behind the origin of the talk idea, execution, and refinement. Hopefully these series of posts will help you in delivering a great, informative presentation and I'd love for you to email me links to any presentations you've built.

## A scary idea

The origin of the copyright talk is a funny one. I remember being at [Windy City Rails](https://windycityrails.com/) 2012 outside the main ballroom on the phone with my attorney. At the time I was about to give a talk called "Choose your own adventure" where the audience got to choose from 10 different lightning talks. One of them was the first version of my copyright talk. Why was I talking to my attorney? I wanted to make sure I would give accurate information and also avoid giving him more work from people taking me to court over bad advice. We quickly hammered out a legal pre-amble just in time for me to give the presentation.

The irony? The audience never selected that talk in the end. I was relieved, but I still wanted to present the information anyway and I would get my chance at Chicago Web Conf later that year. Since the talk was already in a lightning talk format, I got myself into the lightning talks section and nailed the timing of the presentation. Soon after giving the talk, a small group of 5 to 10 people approached me with questions; lots of them. Those questions helped guide what would eventually become the longer format of the talk.

## Outlining version one

After my lightning talk success, I decided it was time to see if this was a talk worth presenting. I finally came up with a talk title which comes from an old viral internet video about copyright. Once I had the title, I quickly made an abstract and submitted the talk to as many calls for proposal as I could find. The first one to come back? Ruby Fuza in South Africa. Yes, I freaked out a bit.

One of the first things I start when sketching out a presentation is to create an outline of the talk. Think of it as the super rough first draft. I write down virtually every idea or bit of information I want to cover. This lets me get as many cards on the table, even if its duplicate or related information. I'm not working on timing at this point, but more of the general flow of content.

Next, I'll edit and organize the outline to form general sections. Outlining is useful for me to start seeing areas where I can group ideas together into sections. Here is an example of the original outline to this talk:
